# 11. Technical Decision Rationale

## 11.1 Architecture Decisions

### 11.1.1 Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

**Decision: Microservices Architecture**

**Rationale:**
- **Scalability**: Different services have different scaling requirements (LLM orchestrator needs more compute, file processor needs more I/O)
- **Technology Diversity**: Each service can use optimal technology stack (e.g., Node.js for API, Python for ML processing if needed)
- **Fault Isolation**: LLM provider failures don't affect file processing or session management
- **Team Scaling**: As team grows, services can be owned by different developers
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed and updated independently

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- Increased complexity in service communication
- Distributed system challenges (network latency, partial failures)
- More complex deployment and monitoring
- Higher infrastructure overhead

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Service mesh for communication management
- Comprehensive monitoring and tracing
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes

### 11.1.2 Database Technology Selection

**Decision: PostgreSQL as Primary Database**

**Rationale:**
- **ACID Compliance**: Critical for session and analytics data consistency
- **JSON Support**: Native JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- **Performance**: Excellent read/write performance for our data patterns
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of tools and extensions
- **Scaling**: Proven horizontal scaling options (read replicas, sharding)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **MongoDB**: Rejected due to consistency requirements and SQL ecosystem benefits
- **MySQL**: Rejected due to inferior JSON support and less advanced features
- **DynamoDB**: Rejected due to vendor lock-in and complex query limitations

**Complementary Technologies:**
- **Redis**: For caching and session management (speed and simplicity)
- **S3/Object Storage**: For temporary file storage (cost and durability)

### 11.1.3 Frontend Technology Stack

**Decision: React + TypeScript + Material-UI**

**Rationale:**
- **React**: Large ecosystem, excellent performance, team familiarity
- **TypeScript**: Type safety critical for complex data structures and API interactions
- **Material-UI**: Consistent design system, accessibility built-in, rapid development
- **PDF.js**: Proven solution for PDF rendering in browsers

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Vue.js**: Rejected due to smaller ecosystem and team expertise
- **Angular**: Rejected due to complexity overhead for our use case
- **Svelte**: Rejected due to smaller ecosystem and learning curve

### 11.1.4 LLM Integration Strategy

**Decision: Multi-Provider Ensemble with Direct API Integration**

**Rationale:**
- **Accuracy**: Ensemble methods proven to increase accuracy over single models
- **Reliability**: Reduces dependence on any single provider
- **Performance**: Can optimize for speed by using fastest available provider
- **Cost Optimization**: Can balance cost vs. accuracy across providers
- **Competitive Advantage**: Unique approach compared to single-model competitors

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Single Provider**: Rejected due to reliability and vendor lock-in risks
- **LangChain Framework**: Considered but adds complexity layer we don't need
- **Open Source Models**: Rejected due to infrastructure requirements and accuracy concerns
- **Fine-tuned Models**: Future consideration, not needed for MVP

## 11.2 Technology Stack Rationale

### 11.2.1 Backend Technology Selection

**Primary Stack: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript**

**Rationale:**
- **JavaScript Ecosystem**: Unified language across frontend and backend
- **Async Performance**: Excellent for I/O heavy operations (API calls, file processing)
- **LLM SDK Support**: Official SDKs available for all target LLM providers
- **Development Speed**: Rapid prototyping and iteration capabilities
- **Team Expertise**: Leverages existing JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge

**Performance Considerations:**
- Event-driven architecture ideal for handling multiple concurrent LLM requests
- Non-blocking I/O perfect for external API integration
- Horizontal scaling easier than vertical scaling

**Alternative Considerations:**
- **Python**: Considered for ML ecosystem but rejected due to performance for web API
- **Go**: Considered for performance but rejected due to ecosystem and development speed
- **Java**: Rejected due to complexity and development velocity

### 11.2.2 Infrastructure and Deployment

**Primary Strategy: Kubernetes on Cloud Provider**

**Rationale:**
- **Container Orchestration**: Essential for microservices management
- **Auto-scaling**: Built-in horizontal and vertical scaling capabilities
- **Service Discovery**: Native service mesh capabilities
- **Rolling Deployments**: Zero-downtime deployment capabilities
- **Multi-cloud**: Kubernetes provides abstraction layer for cloud portability

**Cloud Provider Selection:**
- **AWS**: Primary choice due to mature services and EKS
- **Azure**: Secondary option with strong Kubernetes support
- **GCP**: Alternative with excellent ML/AI service integration

**Deployment Strategy:**
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible infrastructure
- **GitOps**: ArgoCD or Flux for declarative deployment management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for comprehensive automation

### 11.2.3 Monitoring and Observability

**Stack: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK + Jaeger**

**Rationale:**
- **Metrics**: Prometheus for time-series metrics collection
- **Visualization**: Grafana for comprehensive dashboards
- **Logging**: ELK stack for centralized log management
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed request tracing
- **Open Source**: Vendor-neutral, extensible solutions

**Integration Strategy:**
- **Application Metrics**: Custom business metrics alongside infrastructure metrics
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty integration for critical alerts
- **Cost Monitoring**: CloudWatch/Azure Monitor for cloud resource costs
- **User Analytics**: Mixpanel or Amplitude for user behavior tracking

## 11.3 Security and Compliance Decisions

### 11.3.1 Data Protection Strategy

**Decision: Zero Persistence of User Documents**

**Rationale:**
- **Privacy by Design**: Eliminates data breach risks for user documents
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Simplifies GDPR and privacy compliance
- **Trust Building**: Clear value proposition for privacy-conscious users
- **Reduced Liability**: Minimizes legal and financial exposure

**Implementation:**
- 24-hour maximum retention for temporary processing
- Automatic cleanup processes with monitoring
- Encrypted storage for temporary files
- Audit logging for all data access

### 11.3.2 Authentication and Authorization

**Decision: JWT-based Session Management**

**Rationale:**
- **Stateless**: Reduces server-side session storage requirements
- **Scalability**: No shared session state across service instances
- **Performance**: Faster than database-backed sessions
- **Security**: Industry-standard token-based authentication

**Security Measures:**
- Short-lived access tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh token rotation
- Rate limiting per session and IP
- API key rotation for LLM providers

### 11.3.3 Input Validation and Sanitization

**Decision: Multi-layer Validation Approach**

**Rationale:**
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple validation layers reduce attack surface
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides compile-time validation
- **Runtime Validation**: express-validator for runtime input checking
- **File Security**: Dedicated scanning for uploaded PDF files

**Validation Layers:**
1. Frontend validation for user experience
2. API gateway validation for security
3. Service-level validation for business logic
4. Database constraints for data integrity
