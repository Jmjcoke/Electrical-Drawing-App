# 1. Executive Summary

## 1.1 Architecture Overview
This document defines the comprehensive system architecture for the LLM-Powered Electrical Drawing Analysis App, a web-based application that leverages a multi-model ensemble approach using GPT-4V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini Pro for intelligent analysis of electrical drawings.

## 1.2 Core Architectural Principles
- **Microservices Architecture**: Loosely coupled services for scalability and maintainability
- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Distributed LLM processing with consensus mechanisms
- **Cloud-Native Design**: Designed for elastic scaling and high availability
- **Security-First Approach**: Defense in depth with data protection at every layer
- **Performance Optimization**: Sub-15 second response times with 100+ concurrent users
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and analytics for system health

## 1.3 Technology Stack Summary
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Material-UI + PDF.js
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express.js + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Infrastructure**: AWS/Azure/GCP with Kubernetes orchestration
- **LLM Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4V + Anthropic Claude + Google Gemini
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK Stack
