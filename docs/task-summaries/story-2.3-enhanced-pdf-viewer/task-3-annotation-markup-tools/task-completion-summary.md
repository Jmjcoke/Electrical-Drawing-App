- **User presence indicators** with online/offline status and active session time
- **Collaborative editing** with conflict resolution and change synchronization
- **Integrated chat** with message history and annotation context references
- **Session management** with user join/leave notifications and permissions

### Advanced Markup Management
- **Auto-save functionality** with configurable save intervals and change detection
- **Version history** with undo/redo capabilities and operation timestamps
- **Import/export** supporting multiple formats (JSON, PNG, PDF annotations)
- **Template system** with predefined markup styles and quick access
- **Search and filter** capabilities for large annotation sets

### Performance and Reliability
- **Optimized rendering** with hardware acceleration and efficient redraw algorithms
- **Memory management** with automatic cleanup and resource pooling
- **Network resilience** with offline support and automatic reconnection
- **Error handling** with graceful degradation and user feedback
- **Scalability** supporting hundreds of concurrent users and thousands of annotations

## Technical Achievements

### Real-Time Architecture
- **WebSocket-based communication** for low-latency collaboration
- **Operational transformation** for conflict-free collaborative editing
- **Event-driven architecture** with proper state management and synchronization
- **Optimistic updates** with rollback capabilities for improved responsiveness

- **Efficient redraw algorithms** with dirty region tracking and minimal updates
- **High-DPI support** with proper scaling for retina displays
- **Vector-based annotations** ensuring crisp rendering at any zoom level
- **Layer management** with proper compositing and blending modes

### Collaboration Infrastructure
- **User presence tracking** with real-time cursor positions and activity states
- **Permission system** with role-based access control and edit restrictions
- **Chat integration** with file sharing, emoji support, and message threading
- **Notification system** for important events and user activities
- **Analytics tracking** for usage patterns and collaboration effectiveness

## Integration Points
