# Project Brief: ELECTRICAL ORCHESTRATOR

## Introduction / Problem Statement

Brownfield electrical project estimation is the Achilles' heel of oil & gas operations, consistently leading to cost overruns and project delays. Current estimation methods rely on manual drawing analysis, gut instinct, and outdated historical data, resulting in systematic estimation failures that plague the industry. Engineers spend countless hours scrolling through multiple PDF drawing sheets trying to trace circuit connections, while project managers struggle with inaccurate man-hour estimates that don't reflect the complexity of integrating new electrical work with existing brownfield infrastructure.

The ELECTRICAL ORCHESTRATOR solves this by creating an AI-powered platform that transforms static PDF electrical drawings into interactive, intelligent circuit maps while leveraging 5+ years of actual project completion data to provide accurate man-hour estimations for brownfield electrical work.

## Vision & Goals

- **Vision:** Transform brownfield electrical project estimation from guesswork into data-driven precision, making every clouded area on an electrical drawing instantly analyzable and every circuit traceable with accurate cost predictions based on real completion history.

- **Primary Goals:**
  - Goal 1: Achieve 80%+ improvement in brownfield electrical estimation accuracy compared to current manual methods within 6 months of deployment
  - Goal 2: Reduce circuit analysis time from hours to minutes through automated PDF cloud detection and interactive circuit tracing
  - Goal 3: Deploy MVP with 5+ years of historical project data integration for reliable man-hour estimation algorithms
  - Goal 4: Enable real-time project tracking with role-based hour logging (Electrical Lead, Electrician, FCO Lead, FCO Tech, Foreman, General Foreman, Superintendent)
  - Goal 5: Establish cloud-first development approach with clear migration path to on-premise deployment for oil & gas security requirements

- **Success Metrics (Initial Ideas):**
  - Estimation accuracy improvement percentage vs baseline manual methods
  - Time reduction in circuit analysis and estimation activities
  - User adoption rate across different roles (management vs execution level)
  - Project cost variance reduction (estimated vs actual)
  - System uptime and performance metrics in cloud and on-premise environments

- **Compliance Checking:** Automated verification against API standards and safety protocols

## Known Technical Constraints or Preferences

- **Constraints:**
  - Must start cloud-based for rapid development, then migrate to on-premise for oil & gas security requirements
  - PDF format input requirement (no CAD file processing initially)
  - Integration with private cellular networks and company-controlled machines in final deployment
  - Oil & gas industry compliance and security standards
  - Must handle 5+ years of historical project data with 100s of completed projects

- **Initial Architectural Preferences:**
  - Cloud-first development approach (AWS/Azure/GCP evaluation needed)
  - Microservices architecture to support component modularity and future on-premise migration
  - AI/ML decision matrix needed: Traditional computer vision vs LLM approaches for PDF parsing, circuit tracing, and estimation algorithms
  - Scalable database architecture for drawing metadata, historical project data, and real-time tracking
  - API-first design to support future mobile apps and ERP integrations

- **Risks:**
  - PDF parsing accuracy for complex electrical drawings
  - Computer vision reliability for cloud detection in varied drawing formats
  - Historical data quality and standardization across 5+ years of projects
  - Cloud-to-on-premise migration complexity while maintaining feature parity
  - User adoption across different technical skill levels and roles
  - Oil & gas industry sales cycles and procurement processes

- **User Preferences:**
  - Emphasis on man-hour estimation accuracy over material cost estimation
  - Focus on brownfield/modification projects rather than greenfield new construction
  - Circuit complexity limited to relatively simple patterns (2-wire analog instruments, PLC → CTB → ITB → field devices)
  - Role-based access and functionality (management vs execution level users)
  - Real-time progress tracking capabilities for project oversight
