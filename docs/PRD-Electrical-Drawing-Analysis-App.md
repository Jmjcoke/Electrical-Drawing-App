### 12.4 Appendix D: Success Metrics Calculation Methodology

#### 12.4.1 Accuracy Measurement Framework

**Expert Agreement Score Calculation**
```
Expert Agreement Score = (Number of AI responses matching expert analysis / Total number of test responses) × 100

Where:
- Expert analysis conducted by 3+ certified electrical engineers
- Consensus required among experts (2/3 minimum agreement)
- Test set includes 100+ diverse electrical drawing questions
- Scoring conducted blind (experts don't see AI responses initially)
```

**Component Identification Accuracy**
```
Component Accuracy = ((True Positives + True Negatives) / (True Positives + True Negatives + False Positives + False Negatives)) × 100

Where:
- True Positives: Correctly identified components
- True Negatives: Correctly rejected non-components
- False Positives: Incorrectly identified components
- False Negatives: Missed actual components
```

**Response Quality Scoring**
```
Response Quality = Weighted average of:
- Technical Accuracy (40%): Factual correctness of information
- Completeness (25%): Coverage of all relevant aspects
- Clarity (20%): Understandability for target users
- Relevance (15%): Direct applicability to user query

Scale: 1-5 for each dimension, calculated as weighted average
```

#### 12.4.2 Performance Measurement Framework

**Response Time Calculation**
```
Response Time = Time from user query submission to complete response display

Components:
- API Processing Time: Time for LLM provider responses
- Network Latency: Communication delays
- Application Processing: Local computation and aggregation
- Rendering Time: UI update and display time

Measurement: P50, P95, P99 percentiles tracked continuously
```

**Cost per Query Calculation**
```
Cost per Query = (Total LLM API costs + Infrastructure costs + Support costs) / Total number of queries

Breakdown:
- LLM API Costs: Direct charges from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google
- Infrastructure Costs: Server, database, CDN expenses
- Support Costs: Monitoring, logging, customer support tools
- Time Period: Monthly calculation with trending analysis
```

#### 12.4.3 User Satisfaction Measurement Framework

**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
```
NPS = % Promoters (9-10) - % Detractors (0-6)

Collection Method:
- Post-session survey: "How likely are you to recommend this tool to a colleague?"
- Scale: 0-10 where 0 = Not at all likely, 10 = Extremely likely
- Sample size: Minimum 30 responses for statistical significance
- Frequency: Continuous collection with monthly reporting
```

**User Satisfaction Index**
```
Satisfaction Index = Weighted average of:
- Overall Satisfaction (30%): General satisfaction with tool
- Ease of Use (25%): User experience and interface quality
- Accuracy Perception (25%): User's perception of result accuracy
- Value Perception (20%): Perceived value relative to alternatives

Scale: 1-5 for each dimension, target: 4.0+ overall
```
