### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Backend Error Handling]
NLP processing error scenarios:
- Invalid query input (comprehensive sanitization with detailed error messages)
- Classification confidence too low (fallback to general_question with warning)
- Context extraction failures (graceful degradation with partial context)
- Suggestion generation failures (fallback to default suggestions)
- Provider optimization failures (use original query with notification)
- Rate limiting for suggestion requests (prevent autocomplete spam)

### Security Requirements
Input validation and sanitization for NLP processing:
- XSS prevention: HTML stripping and dangerous pattern removal
- Injection prevention: SQL injection and command injection protection
- Content filtering: Inappropriate content detection and filtering
- Rate limiting: Prevent abuse of suggestion and classification endpoints
- Session validation: Ensure all NLP requests are properly authenticated
- Data privacy: No storage of sensitive query content beyond session expiry
