## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2 implementation:
- Multi-file upload foundation is complete with session-based file association
- Backend controller architecture is sound but missing critical service implementations  
- Frontend has excellent FilePreview.tsx component that can be extended for image display
- Testing infrastructure established but requires service implementations to function
- **CRITICAL**: Must implement missing backend services (file.service.ts, validation.service.ts, storage.service.ts) as part of this story

### Architecture Context

**Backend Service Architecture:**
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-structure, architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-technologies]

**File Locations for New/Modified Code:**
- `backend/services/file-processor/src/services/pdf.service.ts` (new - PDF conversion service)
- `backend/services/file-processor/src/services/file.service.ts` (complete implementation)
- `backend/services/file-processor/src/services/storage.service.ts` (implement missing service)
- `backend/services/file-processor/src/utils/conversion.ts` (new - conversion utilities)
- `backend/services/file-processor/src/controllers/upload.controller.ts` (modify for conversion integration)
- `shared/types/api.types.ts` (add conversion-related types)

**Technology Stack:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#backend-technologies]
- Node.js 18+ with Express.js 4.18+ and TypeScript 5.0+
- Use pdf2pic library with poppler-utils for PDF to image conversion
- PostgreSQL for conversion metadata storage
- WebSocket (Socket.io) for real-time progress updates

**Database Schema Context:**
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#documents-table]
- Documents table already supports `image_paths TEXT[]` for storing converted image paths
- `processing_status` field tracks conversion state: 'uploaded' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'error'
- `processing_metadata JSONB` stores conversion details (dimensions, processing time, etc.)

**File Storage Pattern:**
```
backend/storage/
├── sessions/
│   └── {session-id}/
│       ├── uploads/          # Original PDF files
│       └── converted/        # Converted image files
│           ├── {doc-id}/
│           │   ├── page-1.png
│           │   ├── page-2.png
│           │   └── page-3.png
```

**API Specifications:**
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#validation-rules]
- POST /api/v1/upload endpoint triggers automatic conversion after upload
- GET /api/v1/sessions/{sessionId}/documents/{docId}/images returns converted images
- WebSocket events: 'conversion-progress', 'conversion-complete', 'conversion-error'
- Image format: PNG with 300 DPI minimum resolution
- Concurrent processing support for multiple PDFs per session

**Performance Requirements:**
[Source: prd/epic-1-pdf-upload-processing.md#technical-requirements]
- Single page conversion: <10 seconds target
- Multi-page conversion (3 pages): <30 seconds total
- High-resolution output optimized for LLM processing
- Concurrent processing without blocking other operations

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#validation-rules, prd/epic-1-pdf-upload-processing.md]

- Image output format: PNG for compatibility with all LLM providers
- Resolution: 300 DPI minimum for text and component clarity
- File size optimization: Balance quality vs processing speed
- Storage: Temporary storage with 24-hour session expiration
- Concurrency: Support processing multiple PDFs simultaneously per session
- Error handling: Graceful degradation for unsupported PDF formats

### Integration Requirements
**Frontend Integration:**
- Extend existing FilePreview.tsx component to display converted images
- Update progress indicators to show conversion status
- Modify useMultiFileUpload hook to handle conversion states
- Add image loading and error states for converted images

**Backend Integration:**
- Integrate with existing upload.controller.ts workflow
- Extend file validation to include PDF format verification
- Update session cleanup to include converted image files
- Implement proper logging for conversion processes

### Implementation Enhancement Directives

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE FROM PRODUCT OWNER**: During implementation, the development agent MUST incorporate the following production-grade enhancements to ensure system reliability and performance:

#### 1. Performance Monitoring & Metrics Collection
**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Metrics Collection**: Instrument pdf.service.ts with detailed performance metrics using Prometheus-style metrics
  - Conversion duration per page (histogram with buckets: 1s, 5s, 10s, 30s, 60s+)
  - Conversion success/failure rates (counter with labels: success, pdf_corrupt, timeout, memory_error)
  - Queue depth for concurrent conversions (gauge)
  - Memory usage during conversion (gauge with peak/average tracking)
  - File size vs conversion time correlation (summary)

- **Monitoring Integration**: Leverage existing monitoring stack from `infrastructure/monitoring/`
  - Export metrics to Prometheus endpoint at `/metrics`
  - Create Grafana dashboard panels for conversion health
  - Add alerting rules for conversion failures >5% or latency >30s

- **Implementation Pattern**: Add metrics collection in pdf.service.ts using `prom-client` library:
  ```typescript
  // Example pattern - implement similar instrumentation
  const conversionDurationHistogram = new promClient.Histogram({
    name: 'pdf_conversion_duration_seconds',
    help: 'Time taken to convert PDF pages to images',
    labelNames: ['pages', 'file_size_mb'],
    buckets: [1, 5, 10, 30, 60]
  });
  ```

#### 2. Intelligent Caching Strategy
**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Cache Architecture**: Implement Redis-based caching for converted images
  - Cache key pattern: `converted_image:{document_id}:{page_number}:{checksum}`
  - TTL: 24 hours (matching session expiration)
  - Cache invalidation on session cleanup

- **Cache Logic Implementation**: 
  - **Before conversion**: Check Redis cache using document checksum
  - **Cache hit**: Return cached image paths, update access timestamp
  - **Cache miss**: Perform conversion, store in cache with metadata
  - **Storage optimization**: Store image metadata in cache, actual files in filesystem

- **Implementation Location**: Add caching layer in pdf.service.ts and storage.service.ts
  ```typescript
  // Pattern to implement
  async convertPdfToImages(documentId: string, pdfBuffer: Buffer): Promise<ConversionResult> {
    const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey(documentId, pdfBuffer);
    const cached = await this.redis.get(cacheKey);
    if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);
    
    // Perform conversion and cache result
  }
  ```

#### 3. Automated Cleanup & Resource Management
**Implementation Requirements:**
- **Cleanup Service**: Create `cleanup.service.ts` with scheduled cleanup operations
  - **Orphaned file cleanup**: Remove converted images when session expires
  - **Cache cleanup**: Clean Redis entries for expired sessions
  - **Storage optimization**: Compress old conversion logs

- **Cleanup Scheduling**: Implement using Bull queue with cron jobs
  - **Hourly cleanup**: Remove files from expired sessions
  - **Daily cleanup**: Optimize storage, clean old logs, vacuum metrics
  - **Weekly cleanup**: Deep clean orphaned references, rebuild indexes

- **Resource Monitoring**: Track and limit resource usage during conversion
  - **Memory limits**: Implement memory circuit breaker for concurrent conversions
  - **Disk space monitoring**: Alert when storage reaches 80% capacity
  - **Process cleanup**: Ensure poppler processes are properly terminated

- **Implementation Pattern**: Add to session-manager service
  ```typescript
  // Example cleanup job pattern
  @Cron('0 * * * *') // Hourly
  async cleanupExpiredSessions() {
    const expiredSessions = await this.getExpiredSessions();
    await Promise.all(expiredSessions.map(session => 
      this.cleanupSessionFiles(session.id)
    ));
  }
  ```

**IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY**: Implement these enhancements as part of the core conversion tasks, not as separate follow-up work. Each task should incorporate these production-grade considerations to ensure the story delivers enterprise-ready functionality.

**VALIDATION CRITERIA**: The story is not complete until these monitoring, caching, and cleanup capabilities are implemented and tested. Include specific test cases for cache hit/miss scenarios, cleanup effectiveness, and metrics accuracy.
