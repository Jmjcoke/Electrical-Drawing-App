);
```

#### API Endpoints for Context Management
[Source: architecture/5-api-specifications-and-integration-patterns.md#Core API Endpoints]
New endpoints for context management:

#### WebSocket Events for Context Updates
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#WebSocket Communication]
Extended WebSocket events for context management:
```typescript
interface ContextWebSocketEvents {
  // Client to Server
  'context-enhance-query': { queryText: string, sessionId: string }
  'context-reset': { sessionId: string }
  
  // Server to Client
  'context-updated': { contextId: string, turnCount: number }

- **Node.js 18+ LTS**: Runtime for context management services
- **TypeScript 5.0+**: Type safety for complex context data structures
- **PostgreSQL 15+**: Primary storage for context persistence with JSONB support
- **Redis 7.0+**: High-performance caching for active context retrieval
- **Express.js 4.18+**: Web framework for context API endpoints
- **Socket.io**: Real-time context updates and notifications

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Backend Structure]
Primary implementation locations for context management:
- `backend/services/llm-orchestrator/src/context/ConversationContext.ts` - Main context service
- `backend/services/llm-orchestrator/src/context/FollowUpDetector.ts` - Follow-up detection
- `backend/services/llm-orchestrator/src/context/ContextEnricher.ts` - Context enrichment

### Performance Requirements
Context management must maintain real-time user experience:
- Context retrieval: <150ms for relevant context lookup
- Follow-up detection: <200ms for reference analysis
- Context enhancement: <300ms for query enrichment with context
- Context summarization: <500ms for conversation summarization

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Backend Error Handling]
Context management error scenarios:
- Context storage failures (graceful degradation with session-only context)
- Context retrieval timeouts (fallback to basic query processing)
- Follow-up detection failures (process as new query with warning)
- Context summarization errors (use original context with size limits)
- Context corruption (rebuild from query history with validation)
- Memory overflow protection (automatic context pruning with user notification)

### Security Requirements
Context isolation and data protection:
- Session-based context isolation (strict session ID validation)
- Context data encryption at rest (sensitive information protection)
- Context access control (prevent cross-session context leakage)
- Context sanitization (remove sensitive data from context storage)
- Context audit logging (track context access and modifications)
- Context expiration enforcement (automatic cleanup of expired contexts)

### Testing

Testing standards from architecture documentation:
- **Unit Tests**: Jest with 90%+ code coverage requirement on all context components
- **Context Testing**: Persistence and retrieval accuracy across session scenarios
- **Integration Testing**: Full pipeline testing with NLP processing and chat interface

- **Database Design**: Well-designed PostgreSQL schema with proper indexes, foreign keys, and automatic triggers
- **Testing Quality**: Extensive unit test coverage (34 passing tests) with edge cases, performance tests, and comprehensive scenarios
- **Performance Considerations**: In-memory caching with Map-based storage, automatic cleanup, and configurable compression

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/backend/services/llm-orchestrator/src/context/FollowUpDetector.ts`
