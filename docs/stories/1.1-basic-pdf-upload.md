## Technical Implementation Notes

### Frontend Components Required
```
- FileUploadComponent
  - File input/picker interface
  - Upload progress display
  - Error message display
  - Success confirmation
  - File validation (client-side)
```

### Backend API Endpoints Required
```
POST /api/v1/upload
- Accepts multipart/form-data
- Validates file type and size
- Returns upload status and file ID
- Stores file temporarily
```

### Dependencies
- React file upload component library
- Backend file processing middleware
- PDF validation libraries
- Temporary file storage solution

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. User selects valid PDF file under 10MB
2. File uploads successfully with progress indicator
3. System displays preview thumbnail
4. File is ready for analysis

### Error Scenarios
1. User selects non-PDF file → Clear error message displayed
2. User selects PDF over 10MB → File size error with size limit shown
3. Network interruption during upload → Clear error with retry option
4. Server error during processing → Generic error with support contact

### Edge Cases
1. Very small PDF files (under 1KB)
2. PDF files with unusual internal structure
3. Password-protected PDFs
4. Corrupted PDF files

## Success Metrics
- Upload success rate: >95% for valid files
- Average upload time: <30 seconds
- User task completion rate: >90%
- Zero security vulnerabilities in upload process

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk:** Large files cause browser timeout
  - **Mitigation:** Implement chunked upload for files >5MB
- **Risk:** Malicious file uploads
  - **Mitigation:** Server-side validation, virus scanning, sandboxed processing
- **Risk:** Poor error messages confuse users
  - **Mitigation:** User testing of error scenarios, clear actionable messages

## Related Stories
- **Follows:** Project setup and infrastructure (Prerequisites)
- **Enables:** Story 1.2 - Multi-file upload support
- **Enables:** Story 2.1 - Basic LLM integration

## Notes for Implementation
- This is the foundational story that enables all subsequent analysis features
- Focus on reliability and clear user feedback over advanced features
- Implementation should be simple and robust as it will be heavily used
- Consider using established libraries rather than custom upload solutions
- Ensure temporary file cleanup to prevent storage issues
