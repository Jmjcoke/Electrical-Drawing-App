## Dev Technical Guidance
### **Technical Implementation Details**

**Training Data Architecture:**
```typescript
interface TrainingDataset {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  category: DatasetCategory;
  electricalStandard: ElectricalStandard;
  projectType: ProjectType;
  annotations: Annotation[];
  qualityScore: number;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastModified: Date;
}

interface Annotation {
  id: string;
  boundingBox: BoundingBox;
  componentType: ElectricalComponentType;
  specifications: ComponentSpecifications;
  confidence: number;
  annotatedBy: string;
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewStatus: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected';
}

enum ElectricalStandard {
  NEC = 'nec',
  IEC = 'iec',
  ANSI = 'ansi',
  IEEE = 'ieee',
  CUSTOM = 'custom'
}

enum DatasetCategory {
  SYMBOLS = 'symbols',
  LEGENDS = 'legends',
  COMPONENTS = 'components',
  CIRCUITS = 'circuits',
  FULL_DRAWINGS = 'full_drawings'
}
```

**Annotation Tool Integration:**
```typescript
// Canvas-based annotation interface
const AnnotationCanvas: React.FC<{
  imageUrl: string;
  existingAnnotations: Annotation[];
  onAnnotationComplete: (annotation: Annotation) => void;
}> = ({ imageUrl, existingAnnotations, onAnnotationComplete }) => {
  const { fabricCanvas, addBoundingBox, selectComponentType } = useAnnotationCanvas({
    width: 1200,
    height: 800,
    enableDrawing: true
  });
  
  // Integration with existing Fabric.js canvas from Story 3.1
  // Reuse bounding box and overlay components
};
```

**Model Training Pipeline:**
```typescript
interface TrainingJob {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  datasets: string[];
  modelType: 'component_detection' | 'symbol_recognition' | 'text_extraction';
  status: 'queued' | 'training' | 'validating' | 'complete' | 'failed';
  progress: number;
  metrics: TrainingMetrics;
  startTime: Date;
  estimatedCompletion?: Date;
}

interface TrainingMetrics {
  accuracy: number;
  precision: number;
  recall: number;
  f1Score: number;
  validationLoss: number;
  trainingLoss: number;
}
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- Upload processing: <30 seconds for 50MB files
- Annotation tools: <100ms response for drawing operations
- Training job queuing: <5 seconds to start
- Data search/filtering: <500ms for 10,000+ items

**Integration Points:**
- Computer Vision Service: `/api/v1/cv/training-data`
- MLflow Model Registry: `/api/v1/models/training`
- File Storage: AWS S3 or equivalent for training data
- Database: PostgreSQL for metadata and annotations

**Security Considerations:**
- Role-based access control (admin, annotator, reviewer)
- Training data encryption at rest
- Audit logging for all training data operations
- IP protection for proprietary symbols and standards
