## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 2.1-2.4 completion, key learnings relevant to consensus and confidence scoring:
- Ensemble orchestration provides standardized response format across all providers via EnsembleResponse structure
- Response aggregation framework exists with basic consensus building in ResponseAggregator class
- Provider responses follow consistent LLMResponse interface with confidence fields
- Statistical confidence measures are partially implemented in ensemble.confidence.ts but need enhancement
- Component clustering algorithms exist in consensus.service.ts but require confidence integration
- Circuit breaker and health monitoring provide provider reliability context for confidence weighting

### Architecture Context

#### Consensus and Confidence Scoring Architecture
[Source: architecture/4-data-flow-and-processing-pipelines.md#4.3]
```typescript
// Enhanced Confidence Scoring Architecture
interface ConfidenceScore {
  overall: number;
  agreement: number;
  completeness: number;
  consistency: number;
  factors: {
    modelConsensus: number;
    responseQuality: number;
    logicalConsistency: number;
    coverage: number;
    uncertainty: number;
  };
}

// Advanced Agreement Analysis
class AgreementAnalyzer {
  calculateInterModelAgreement(responses: LLMResponse[]): AgreementMeasures {
    return {
      semanticSimilarity: this.calculateSemanticSimilarity(responses),
      structuralSimilarity: this.calculateStructuralSimilarity(responses),
      correlationCoefficient: this.calculateCorrelation(responses),
      variance: this.calculateResponseVariance(responses),
      entropy: this.calculateResponseEntropy(responses)
    }
  }
}
```

#### Consensus Clustering for Components
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#3.3.1]
Component identification consensus requires spatial and semantic clustering:
```typescript
interface ComponentConsensus {
  clusteredComponents: ComponentCluster[];
  confidenceScores: ComponentConfidence[];
  disagreements: ComponentDisagreement[];
  spatialAgreement: SpatialAgreementMeasure;
}

class ComponentConsensusClustering {
  async clusterComponents(responses: LLMResponse[]): Promise<ComponentConsensus> {
    const allComponents = responses.flatMap(r => r.components || [])
    
    // Spatial clustering based on location proximity
    const spatialClusters = await this.spatialClustering(allComponents)
    
    // Semantic clustering based on component type and description
    const semanticClusters = await this.semanticClustering(spatialClusters)
    
    return this.buildConsensus(semanticClusters)
  }
}
```

### Data Flow Integration
[Source: architecture/4-data-flow-and-processing-pipelines.md#4.3]
Enhanced response aggregation pipeline with advanced consensus and confidence:
1. **Ensemble Response Input**: Receive aggregated responses from orchestration engine
2. **Agreement Analysis**: Calculate inter-model agreement using semantic and statistical measures
3. **Confidence Calculation**: Compute multi-factor confidence scores with uncertainty quantification
4. **Component Consensus**: Cluster component identifications with spatial and semantic analysis
5. **Text Consensus**: Rank and merge text responses based on agreement and quality
6. **Uncertainty Propagation**: Calculate and propagate uncertainty measures throughout results
7. **Confidence Integration**: Integrate confidence scores into final analysis results

### Performance Requirements
Response aggregation with advanced consensus must maintain performance:
- Consensus analysis completion: <3 seconds additional processing time
- Component clustering: Handle up to 100 identified components efficiently
- Statistical calculations: Optimize for real-time confidence scoring
- Memory efficiency: Manage large response datasets for agreement analysis

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Backend Error Handling]
Consensus and confidence error scenarios:
- Insufficient responses for consensus (handle single model scenarios)
- Statistical calculation failures (division by zero, invalid data)
- Clustering algorithm failures (empty clusters, convergence issues)
- Configuration validation errors (invalid thresholds, missing parameters)
- Uncertainty calculation overflows (handle extreme variance scenarios)

### Configuration Schema
Expected configuration structure for consensus and confidence scoring:
```typescript
interface ConsensusConfig {
  agreement: {
    semanticSimilarityThreshold: number;
    correlationMinimum: number;
    entropyWeighting: number;
    varianceThreshold: number;
  };
  confidence: {
    factors: {
      agreement: number;
      quality: number;
      consistency: number;
      coverage: number;
      uncertainty: number;
    };
    thresholds: {
      high: number;
      medium: number;
      low: number;
    };
    normalization: 'minmax' | 'zscore' | 'sigmoid';
  };
  clustering: {
    componentSpatialThreshold: number;
    semanticSimilarityThreshold: number;
    minimumClusterSize: number;
    maxClusters: number;
  };
  uncertainty: {
    confidenceIntervals: boolean;
    propagateUncertainty: boolean;
    uncertaintyWeighting: number;
  };
}
```
