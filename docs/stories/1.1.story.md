## Dev Technical Guidance

### **Project Structure Implementation**
- **Complete Directory Structure:** Follow the comprehensive structure defined in `electrical-orchestrator-architecture.md Section 4`
- **Shared Code Organization:** Create `src/backend/shared/` directory with common utilities for database, Redis, authentication, and configuration
- **Docker Configuration:** Place all Dockerfiles in `src/backend/docker/` with separate files for gateway and microservices
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Use `infra/` directory for AWS CDK configuration and Kubernetes manifests

### **Database Architecture**
- **PostgreSQL Configuration:** 
  - Use PostgreSQL 15.x with connection pooling via SQLAlchemy
  - Database URL: `postgresql://username:password@postgres:5432/electrical_orchestrator`
  - Enable extensions: `uuid-ossp`, `postgis` (for geographic data if needed)
- **Redis Configuration:**
  - Redis 7.x for session storage, job queues, and caching
  - Connection: `redis://redis:6379`
  - Configure persistence with AOF (append-only file)
- **Migration System:** 
  - Use Alembic for database schema migrations
  - Place migration files in `src/backend/shared/database/migrations/`
  - Auto-generate migrations from SQLAlchemy models

### **Backend Gateway Service**
- **FastAPI Configuration:**
  - Base URL: `http://localhost:8000` for development
  - Enable CORS, rate limiting, and request/response logging
  - Use dependency injection for database and Redis connections
- **Service Communication:**
  - Internal service URLs: `http://service-name:8001` pattern
  - Use service discovery for Kubernetes deployment
  - Implement circuit breaker pattern for service resilience
- **Shared Utilities:**
  - Database session management with async SQLAlchemy
  - Redis client configuration with connection pooling
  - JWT token validation utilities for authentication
  - Structured logging configuration with correlation IDs

### **Frontend Foundation**
- **Next.js 14 Configuration:**
  - Use App Router with server components
  - Enable TypeScript strict mode and ESLint
  - Configure environment variables for API endpoints
- **Tailwind CSS Setup:**
  - Import ELECTRICAL ORCHESTRATOR color palette from UI/UX specification
  - Configure responsive breakpoints for desktop and mobile
  - Set up component classes for consistent styling
- **Development Server:** Port 3000 with hot reloading and fast refresh

### **Docker and Orchestration**
- **Docker Compose Services:**
  ```yaml
  services:
    postgres: PostgreSQL 15 with persistent volume
    redis: Redis 7 with persistence configuration
    gateway: FastAPI gateway service
    frontend: Next.js development server
    auth-service: Authentication microservice (from Story 1.2)
  ```
- **Kubernetes Configuration:**
  - Use namespaces for environment separation
  - ConfigMaps for environment-specific configuration
  - Secrets for sensitive data (database passwords, JWT keys)
  - Persistent volumes for database data

### **CI/CD Pipeline Requirements**
- **GitHub Actions Workflows:**
  - `.github/workflows/main.yml` - Main CI/CD pipeline
  - `.github/workflows/security.yml` - Security scanning
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Deployment automation
- **Testing Pipeline:**
  - Backend: pytest with coverage reporting
  - Frontend: Jest and Playwright for E2E testing
  - Security: SAST scanning with CodeQL
- **Deployment Pipeline:**
  - Staging deployment on pull requests
  - Production deployment on main branch merge
  - Rollback capabilities for failed deployments

### **Environment Configuration**
- **Development Environment:**
  - Local Docker Compose with hot reloading
  - Environment variables from `.env.local`
  - Debug logging enabled
- **Production Environment:**
  - Kubernetes deployment with auto-scaling
  - Environment variables from ConfigMaps and Secrets
  - Structured logging with centralized collection
- **Configuration Management:**
  - Use Pydantic for backend configuration validation
  - Environment-specific overrides for database URLs, API endpoints
  - Secure secret management for production deployment

### **Health Monitoring and Logging**
- **Health Check Endpoints:**
  - `/health` - Basic service health
  - `/health/detailed` - Detailed component status (database, Redis, external services)
  - `/metrics` - Prometheus-compatible metrics
- **Logging Configuration:**
  - Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
  - Log levels: DEBUG (dev), INFO (staging), WARN (production)
  - Integration with centralized logging system (CloudWatch, ELK stack)
- **Monitoring Requirements:**
  - Service availability monitoring
  - Database connection pool monitoring
  - Redis memory usage tracking
  - API response time and error rate tracking

### **Security Considerations**
- **Container Security:**
  - Use official base images with latest security patches
  - Non-root user execution in containers
  - Security scanning of container images
- **Network Security:**
  - Internal service communication over private networks
  - TLS/SSL termination at load balancer
  - Network policies for service isolation
- **Data Security:**
  - Encrypted database connections
  - Secure secret management (Kubernetes secrets, AWS Parameter Store)
  - Regular security vulnerability scanning
