## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 implementation:
- Single file upload foundation is solid with React FileUpload component, Material-UI integration, and Express.js backend
- File validation using multiple techniques (MIME + magic bytes + PDF structure) is working well
- Temporary storage and cleanup mechanisms are in place
- Error handling patterns are established and should be extended

### Frontend Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-structure, architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-technologies]

**Component Structure:**
- Extend existing `frontend/src/components/upload/FileUpload.tsx` component
- Modify `frontend/src/components/upload/ProgressIndicator.tsx` for multiple progress tracking
- Update `frontend/src/components/upload/FilePreview.tsx` for multiple file thumbnails
- Use established React 18.2+ with TypeScript 5.0+ and Material-UI 5.0+

**File Locations for New/Modified Code:**
- `frontend/src/components/upload/FileUpload.tsx` (modify existing)
- `frontend/src/components/upload/MultiFileProgress.tsx` (new component)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useMultiFileUpload.ts` (new custom hook)
- `frontend/src/types/api.ts` (update existing interfaces)

### Backend Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#backend-structure, architecture/data-models.md#database-schema]

**Service Architecture:**
- Extend existing `backend/services/file-processor/src/controllers/upload.controller.ts`
- Modify `backend/services/file-processor/src/services/file.service.ts` for concurrent processing
- Use established Express.js 4.18+ with TypeScript 5.0+ and multer for file handling
- Database schema already supports multiple documents per session via documents table

**API Specifications:**
[Source: architecture/12-appendices.md#api-documentation]
- POST /api/v1/upload endpoint supports multipart/form-data with files array (maxItems: 3)
- Each file validates: PDF format, max 10MB, proper server-side validation
- Documents table association: session_id ‚Üí multiple document records
- Processing status tracking per document: 'uploaded' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'error'

**File Storage Pattern:**
- Temporary storage per session with automatic cleanup
- Concurrent PDF to image conversion using existing conversion service
- File paths stored in documents.file_path and documents.image_paths arrays

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#validation-rules, prd/epic-1-pdf-upload-processing.md]

- Maximum 3 files per session (Epic 1 requirement)
- File size limits: 10MB per file, 30MB total calculated
- PDF format validation using established magic bytes + PDF structure checking
- Session-based temporary storage (24-hour expiration)
- Concurrent processing for performance (<60 seconds total upload time)

### Testing Strategy Context
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#frontend-testing, architecture/testing-strategy.md#backend-testing]

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests using Jest + React Testing Library for components
- Custom hook testing with renderHook for useMultiFileUpload
- Integration tests with supertest for multi-file upload endpoint
- Mock file testing with multiple File objects
- Performance testing for concurrent upload scenarios
- Error scenario testing for partial failures

**Test File Locations:**
- `frontend/src/components/upload/__tests__/FileUpload.test.tsx` (extend existing)
- `frontend/src/hooks/__tests__/useMultiFileUpload.test.ts` (new)
- `backend/services/file-processor/src/__tests__/upload.controller.test.ts` (extend existing)
- `backend/services/file-processor/src/__tests__/file.service.test.ts` (extend existing)

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

### Test Requirements
- Unit test coverage >90% following existing patterns
- Jest + React Testing Library for frontend components
- Supertest for backend API integration tests
- Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API service testing
- Performance testing for concurrent file uploads

### Testing Standards
- Co-locate component tests: `ComponentName.test.tsx` alongside components
- Backend tests in `__tests__` directories within service folders
- Use established test utilities in `shared/test-utils/`
- Follow existing mock patterns and error scenario coverage

  - **How**: Wrapped async operations in proper act calls for React Testing Library

### Final Verdict - CORRECTED
**Story Status: COMPLETE** ‚úÖ  
**Recommendation: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**

**Quality Summary:**
- All 15 acceptance criteria met
- Backend compiles and functions correctly  
- Frontend implementation is feature-complete and well-architected
- Test coverage is comprehensive with fixed async handling
- User experience meets all requirements

**Minor Improvements for Future Iterations:**
1. Consider unified API endpoint design
