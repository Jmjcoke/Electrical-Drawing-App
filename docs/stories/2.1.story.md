- [ ] **Task 7: Testing and Quality Assurance** (All ACs)
  - Create comprehensive test suite for PDF processing
  - Test with various electrical drawing formats and qualities
  - Validate security measures and access controls
  - Performance testing for large file uploads and processing

## Technical Guidance

### Backend Implementation
- **FastAPI Service:** Create dedicated PDF processing service with async file handling
- **Storage Integration:** Use AWS S3 or compatible storage with presigned URL uploads
- **Security:** Implement ClamAV or similar for virus scanning, strict file type validation
- **Processing Pipeline:** Async task queue for PDF processing with status tracking
- **Database Schema:** Extend project models to include drawing entities and metadata

### Frontend Implementation
- **File Upload Component:** React component with drag-and-drop using react-dropzone
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time upload progress with WebSocket or polling
- **Preview Interface:** PDF.js integration for in-browser PDF viewing
- **Management UI:** File listing, organization, and metadata editing capabilities

### PDF Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload Validation:** File type, size, virus scan
2. **Format Verification:** PDF structure validation, CAD system detection
3. **Quality Assessment:** Resolution check, readability analysis
4. **Page Processing:** Thumbnail generation, metadata extraction
5. **Storage:** Secure storage with backup and versioning
6. **Database Record:** Create drawing entity with processed metadata

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation:** Strict PDF format validation and sanitization
- **Access Control:** Project-based permissions for drawing access
- **Audit Logging:** Track all upload and access activities
- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt stored files and metadata

## Definition of Done

- [ ] **Functional Requirements:**
  - [ ] Users can securely upload PDF files through web interface
  - [ ] System validates PDF format and performs security scanning
  - [ ] Multi-page PDFs are processed with thumbnail generation
  - [ ] Files are stored securely with backup and retrieval capabilities
  - [ ] Upload progress is tracked and errors are handled gracefully

- [ ] **Technical Requirements:**
  - [ ] PDF processing service integrated with main application
  - [ ] S3-compatible storage configured with proper access controls
  - [ ] Database schema extended for drawing management
  - [ ] Frontend components for upload and file management
  - [ ] Integration with existing project management system

- [ ] **Quality Assurance:**
  - [ ] Comprehensive test suite covering all upload scenarios
  - [ ] Security testing including virus scanning and input validation
  - [ ] Performance testing with large files and concurrent uploads
  - [ ] Compatibility testing with various electrical drawing formats
  - [ ] End-to-end testing of complete upload-to-storage workflow

- [ ] **Documentation & Deployment:**
  - [ ] API documentation for PDF processing endpoints
  - [ ] User documentation for upload procedures
  - [ ] Deployment scripts and configuration for PDF processing service
  - [ ] Monitoring and logging setup for file operations

## Priority: High

## Estimated Effort: 3-4 sprints

## Dependencies
- Story 1.3 (Project Creation and Configuration Management) - COMPLETED
- AWS S3 or compatible storage service configuration
- ClamAV or virus scanning service setup

## Notes
- This story establishes the foundation for all subsequent PDF analysis features
- Focus on security and reliability given the sensitive nature of electrical drawings
- Performance is critical for user adoption, especially with large multi-page drawings
- Consider implementing progressive enhancement for advanced PDF features
