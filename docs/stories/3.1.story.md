# Story 3.1: Interactive Drawing Canvas with AI Overlays

## Status: In-Progress

## Story
- As an **electrical contractor**
- I want **an interactive drawing canvas that displays AI-detected components with visual overlays**
- so that **I can see exactly what the AI has identified in my electrical drawings and interact with those components**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
1. **Interactive Canvas Rendering**: Drawing canvas displays PDF drawings with zoom, pan, and selection controls optimized for large technical drawings
2. **AI Component Overlays**: Computer Vision Service detections are rendered as interactive bounding boxes with component type labels and confidence indicators
3. **Real-time Visual Feedback**: Canvas immediately reflects AI processing updates through WebSocket connections with visual progress indicators
4. **Component Selection Interface**: Users can click on detected components to view detailed specifications and trigger circuit tracing
5. **Performance Optimization**: Canvas maintains smooth 60fps interactions even with 100+ detected components on complex drawings

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Fabric.js Canvas Integration**
  - [x] Implement HTML5 canvas with Fabric.js for drawing interactions
  - [x] Add PDF.js integration for high-quality PDF rendering
  - [x] Create responsive canvas layout within Next.js workspace
  - [x] Implement zoom controls (mouse wheel + zoom buttons) with bounds checking

- [x] **AI Overlay System**
  - [x] Build ComponentDetectionOverlay component with bounding box rendering
  - [x] Create confidence indicator UI (color-coded: green >85%, yellow 70-85%, red <70%)
  - [x] Implement component type labels with dynamic positioning
  - [x] Add hover effects and selection states for detected components

- [x] **WebSocket Integration for Real-time Updates**
  - [x] Implement AIWebSocketManager for real-time AI processing updates
  - [x] Create useAIAnalysisUpdates hook for component updates
  - [x] Add processing progress indicators with stage-based updates
  - [x] Handle WebSocket reconnection and error states gracefully

- [x] **Canvas Performance Optimization**
  - [x] Implement virtual rendering for large drawings (only render visible region)
  - [x] Add object pooling for component detection overlays
  - [x] Create debounced overlay updates to prevent UI thrashing
  - [x] Optimize canvas redraw cycles with dirty region tracking

- [x] **Component Interaction System**
  - [x] Create click handlers for component selection with multi-select support
  - [x] Implement component context menu with actions (trace circuit, view specs)
  - [x] Add keyboard shortcuts for canvas navigation (arrow keys, +/- zoom)
  - [x] Build component details sidebar triggered by selection

## Dev Technical Guidance
### **Technical Implementation Details**

**Canvas Architecture:**
```typescript
// Core canvas component structure
interface DrawingCanvasProps {
  drawingId: string;
  aiDetections: ComponentDetection[];
  onComponentSelect: (component: ComponentDetection) => void;
  confidenceThreshold: number;
}

// Fabric.js canvas setup with AI overlay management
const OptimizedDrawingCanvas: React.FC<DrawingCanvasProps> = ({
  drawingId,
  aiDetections
}) => {
  const { fabricCanvas, canvasRef } = useFabricCanvas({
    width: 1200,
    height: 800,
    enableSelection: true,
    enableZoom: true
  });
  
  const { visibleRegion } = useVirtualCanvas({
    canvasSize: drawingDimensions,
    viewportSize: containerDimensions
  });
};
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- Canvas initialization: <2 seconds
- Zoom/pan response: <100ms
- Component overlay rendering: <200ms for 100+ components
- Memory usage: <200MB for drawing cache

**AI Service Integration:**
- Computer Vision Service via `/api/v1/cv/analyze-drawing`
- WebSocket endpoint: `/ws/analysis/${analysisId}`
- Cache AI results in Zustand store for 30 minutes
- Graceful fallback to cached results if AI service unavailable

**Security Considerations:**
- Validate drawing file size limits (max 50MB)
- Sanitize PDF content before rendering
- Rate limit AI analysis requests (max 3 concurrent per user)
