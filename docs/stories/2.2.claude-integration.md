## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 2.1 completion, key learnings relevant to Claude integration:
- Provider framework uses strict TypeScript with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- All error handling must use proper type guards for `unknown` error conversion
- Factory pattern requires provider registration in ProviderFactory constructor
- Circuit breaker instances are provider-specific and configured per provider
- Cost tracking system expects standardized token counting interface

### Architecture Context

#### LLM Provider Interface Requirements
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#3.3.1]
```typescript
interface LLMProvider {
  name: string
  version: string
  analyze(image: Buffer, prompt: string, options?: AnalysisOptions): Promise<LLMResponse>
  healthCheck(): Promise<boolean>
  getRateLimit(): RateLimitInfo
  getCost(tokens: number): number
}
```

#### Claude Implementation Pattern
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#3.3.1]
```typescript
class AnthropicProvider implements LLMProvider {
  private client: Anthropic
  name = 'claude-3-5-sonnet'
  version = '20241022'
  
  async analyze(image: Buffer, prompt: string): Promise<LLMResponse> {
    const base64Image = image.toString('base64')
    const response = await this.client.messages.create({
      model: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
      max_tokens: 4096,
      messages: [{
        role: 'user',
        content: [
          { type: 'text', text: prompt },
          { type: 'image', source: { type: 'base64', media_type: 'image/jpeg', data: base64Image }}
        ]
      }]
    })
    
    return this.parseResponse(response)
  }
}
```

**File**: `src/providers/claude.provider.ts`
- **Change**: Removed empty lines in healthCheck method
- **Why**: Clean up formatting inconsistencies that affected code readability
- **How**: Removed unnecessary blank lines while maintaining proper method structure

**File**: `src/providers/registry.ts`
- **Change**: Improved type safety by replacing `any` types with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Why**: Enhanced type safety and maintainability, following strict TypeScript best practices
- **How**: Added proper typing for provider configurations and used LLMProvider interface instead of any
