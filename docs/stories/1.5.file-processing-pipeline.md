# Story 1.5: File Processing Pipeline Integration

## Status
**ARCHIVED** - Duplicate of Story 1.3

## Archive Reason
This story was created in error as it duplicates functionality already implemented in Story 1.3: PDF to Image Conversion. Story 1.3 already includes:
- PDF to image conversion with 300 DPI output
- Background job processing with Bull queues
- Real-time WebSocket status updates  
- Provider-specific image optimization
- File storage management and cleanup
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization (<30 seconds)

All acceptance criteria listed in this story are already met by Story 1.3.

## Story
**As an** electrical professional,  
**I want** my uploaded PDF files to be automatically processed and converted to high-resolution images optimized for AI analysis,  
**so that** the system can efficiently analyze my drawings using multiple LLM providers without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Uploaded PDF files are automatically processed in the background
2. PDF pages are converted to high-resolution images (300 DPI minimum)
3. Images are optimized for each LLM provider's specific requirements
4. Processing status is tracked and communicated to the user in real-time
5. Processed files are stored securely with appropriate retention policies
6. Error handling provides clear feedback for processing failures
7. Processing completes within 2 minutes for standard electrical drawings

  - [ ] Add validation for corrupted or unsupported PDF formats
  - [ ] Create user-friendly error messages and recovery options
  - [ ] Implement retry logic for transient failures
- [ ] Performance optimization (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Optimize conversion algorithms for speed
  - [ ] Implement parallel processing for multi-page documents
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
Based on the progression, Stories 1.1-1.4 should have established:
- Basic file upload infrastructure
- Frontend upload UI components
- File validation systems  
- PDF preview capabilities

### Relevant Source Tree Information
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**Backend Service Location:**
- Main processing service: `backend/services/file-processor/`
- PDF service implementation: `backend/services/file-processor/src/services/pdf.service.ts`
- File storage service: `backend/services/file-processor/src/services/storage.service.ts`
- Job queue setup: `backend/services/file-processor/src/utils/`

**Frontend Integration:**
- Progress tracking: `frontend/src/components/upload/ProgressIndicator.tsx`
- WebSocket integration: `frontend/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts`
- Upload service: `frontend/src/services/pdf.ts`

### Technical Architecture Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Core Technologies:**
- Node.js 18+ LTS with Express.js for backend processing
- Bull 4.0+ for job queue management
- Redis 7.0+ for caching and job storage
- PDF.js 3.0+ for server-side PDF processing
- Socket.io for real-time status communication

**File Processing Pipeline:**
- PDF parsing and validation using PDF.js
- High-resolution image conversion (300+ DPI)
- Multi-provider image optimization:
  - OpenAI GPT-4 Vision: JPEG format, max 2048x2048
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet: PNG format, max 1568x1568  
  - Gemini Pro Vision: JPEG format, max 4096x4096

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md - inferred from epic requirements]

```typescript
interface ProcessingJob {
  id: string;
  documentId: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'failed';
  progress: number; // 0-100
  createdAt: Date;
  completedAt?: Date;
  errorMessage?: string;
}

interface ProcessedDocument {
  id: string;
  originalFileId: string;
  images: ProcessedImage[];
  status: 'processing' | 'ready' | 'failed';
  processingTime: number;
}

interface ProcessedImage {
  providerId: 'openai' | 'claude' | 'gemini' | 'local';
  imageUrl: string;
  format: 'jpeg' | 'png';
  dimensions: { width: number; height: number };
  fileSize: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture/api-specifications.md - inferred from epic requirements]

**Processing Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/files/process` - Trigger file processing
- `GET /api/v1/files/{id}/status` - Get processing status  
- `GET /api/v1/files/{id}/images` - Retrieve processed images
- `DELETE /api/v1/files/{id}` - Clean up processed files

**WebSocket Events:**
- `processing:started` - Processing job initiated
- `processing:progress` - Progress update (0-100%)
- `processing:completed` - Processing finished successfully
- `processing:failed` - Processing failed with error details

### File Storage Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

```
storage/
├── uploads/              # Original PDF files (temporary)
├── processed/            # Processed images
