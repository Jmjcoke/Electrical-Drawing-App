# Story 3.2: Real-time AI Analysis Interface

## Status: In-Progress

## Story
- As an **electrical contractor**
- I want **real-time updates on AI analysis progress with confidence controls and processing status**
- so that **I can monitor AI processing, adjust confidence thresholds, and continue working while analysis completes**

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)
1. **Real-time Processing Updates**: AI analysis progress displays live updates for each processing stage (Component Detection → Cloud Detection → Circuit Analysis → Estimation)
2. **Confidence Threshold Controls**: Dynamic slider controls allow users to adjust confidence thresholds (0.5-0.95) with immediate visual feedback on detection count
3. **Processing Queue Management**: Multiple drawing analysis requests are queued and displayed with estimated completion times and cancellation options
4. **Fallback Mode Interface**: When AI services are unavailable, interface gracefully degrades to manual mode with clear status indicators
5. **WebSocket Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection handling and connection status indicators ensure reliable real-time updates

  - [x] Implement AIProcessingQueue component with job status tracking
  - [x] Create queue item management (cancel, reorder, retry)
  - [x] Add estimated completion time calculation based on drawing complexity
  - [x] Build queue persistence across browser sessions

- [x] **Fallback Mode System**
  - [x] Create AIServiceHealthMonitor with service status checking
  - [x] Implement graceful degradation UI with manual mode indicators

  - [x] Add connection quality metrics (latency, packet loss)
  - [x] Build manual reconnection controls for troubleshooting

## Dev Technical Guidance
### **Technical Implementation Details**

**WebSocket State Management:**
```typescript
// AI analysis state with real-time updates
interface AIAnalysisState {
  currentAnalysis: AnalysisSession | null;
  processingQueue: AITask[];
  connectionStatus: WebSocketStatus;
  confidenceThreshold: number;
  isProcessing: boolean;
  processingStage: 'idle' | 'component-detection' | 'cloud-detection' | 'circuit-analysis' | 'estimation' | 'complete';
}

// WebSocket integration with automatic reconnection
const useAIAnalysisUpdates = (analysisId: string) => {
  const [connectionStatus, setConnectionStatus] = useState<WebSocketStatus>('connecting');
  
  const webSocketManager = useMemo(() => new AIWebSocketManager({
    wsEndpoint: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_WS_ENDPOINT!,
    reconnectAttempts: 5,
    reconnectDelay: 1000
  }), []);
};
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- WebSocket message processing: <50ms latency
- Confidence threshold updates: <200ms visual response
- Queue operations: <100ms for add/remove/cancel
- Connection recovery: <5 seconds maximum downtime

**AI Service Health Monitoring:**
```typescript
// Service health checking with circuit breaker pattern
interface AIServiceHealth {
  computerVision: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unavailable';
  cloudDetection: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unavailable';
  circuitTracing: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unavailable';
  componentIntelligence: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unavailable';
  estimationEngine: 'healthy' | 'degraded' | 'unavailable';
}

// Health check endpoints
const healthEndpoints = {
  computerVision: '/api/v1/cv/health',
  cloudDetection: '/api/v1/cloud/health',
  circuitTracing: '/api/v1/circuit/health',
  componentIntelligence: '/api/v1/components/health',
  estimationEngine: '/api/v1/estimation/health'
};
```

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- Network errors: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Service errors: Graceful degradation to manual mode
- Invalid responses: Data validation with user notification
- Connection timeouts: Fallback to polling mode

**Security Considerations:**
- WebSocket authentication via JWT tokens
- Rate limiting for confidence threshold changes
- Queue operation authorization checks
- Connection origin validation
