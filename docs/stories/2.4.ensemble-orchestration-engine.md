## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 2.1-2.3 completion, key learnings relevant to ensemble orchestration:
- Provider framework uses strict TypeScript with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true` for type safety
- All providers implement LLMProvider interface with standardized methods (analyze, healthCheck, getRateLimit, getCost)
- Circuit breaker patterns are provider-specific and configured per provider in BaseProvider framework
- Provider factory pattern enables dynamic registration and discovery of available providers
- Response format is standardized as LLMResponse with consistent confidence scoring across providers
- Error handling follows standardized ErrorResponse format with proper error categorization
- Media type detection and image processing patterns are established across all providers
- Rate limiting and cost tracking are implemented at provider level with aggregation needs at ensemble level

### Architecture Context

#### Ensemble Orchestration Pattern
[Source: architecture/3-detailed-component-architecture.md#3.3.1]
```typescript
// Ensemble Orchestrator Implementation
class LLMEnsemble {
  private providers: LLMProvider[]
  private circuitBreaker: CircuitBreaker
  
  async analyzeWithEnsemble(image: Buffer, prompt: string): Promise<EnsembleResponse> {
    const promises = this.providers.map(provider => 
      this.executeWithCircuitBreaker(provider, image, prompt)
    )
    
    const responses = await Promise.allSettled(promises)
    return this.buildConsensus(responses)
  }
  
  private buildConsensus(responses: PromiseSettledResult<LLMResponse>[]): EnsembleResponse {
    const successfulResponses = responses
      .filter(r => r.status === 'fulfilled')
      .map(r => (r as PromiseFulfilledResult<LLMResponse>).value)
    
    return {
      consensus: this.calculateConsensus(successfulResponses),
      individual: successfulResponses,
      confidence: this.calculateConfidence(successfulResponses),
      aggregated: this.aggregateResponses(successfulResponses)
    }
  }
}
```

#### Response Aggregation Architecture
[Source: architecture/4-data-flow-and-processing-pipelines.md#4.3]
```typescript
// Response Aggregation and Consensus
class ResponseAggregator {
  async aggregate(ensembleResponse: EnsembleResponse, query: AnalysisQuery): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
    const responses = ensembleResponse.individual
    
    // Component Analysis Aggregation
    const components = await this.aggregateComponentIdentifications(responses)
    
    // Question Answer Aggregation
    const answer = await this.aggregateTextResponses(responses)
    
    // Confidence Scoring
    const confidence = await this.calculateConfidenceScore(responses, query)
    
    // Schematic Data Aggregation
    const schematicData = await this.aggregateSchematicData(responses)
    
    return {
      answer,
      components,
      schematicData,
      confidence,
      modelComparison: this.buildModelComparison(responses),
      metadata: {
        processingTime: ensembleResponse.metadata.totalTime,
        modelsUsed: responses.map(r => r.model),
        consensus: ensembleResponse.consensus
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Flow Architecture
[Source: architecture/4-data-flow-and-processing-pipelines.md#4.2]
Query processing pipeline for ensemble orchestration:
1. **Query Validation and Context**: Session lookup and document retrieval
2. **Parallel LLM Processing**: Simultaneous execution across all providers
3. **Response Aggregation**: Consensus building and confidence scoring
4. **Result Formatting**: Standardized response format with metadata
5. **Storage and Delivery**: Result persistence and client notification

Performance Requirements:
- Total ensemble response time: <15 seconds
- Individual provider timeout: <10 seconds to allow retry time
- Parallel execution efficiency: Minimize wait time for slowest provider
- Graceful degradation: System functional with single provider failures

### Error Handling Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Backend Error Handling]
Ensemble orchestration error scenarios to handle:
- Single provider failures (continue with available providers)
- Multiple provider failures (minimum viable response with confidence degradation)
- Timeout handling (individual provider timeouts within ensemble timeout)
- Circuit breaker activation (temporary provider exclusion)
- Aggregation failures (fallback to individual responses)
- Configuration errors (invalid provider settings)

Error response format for ensemble failures:
```typescript
interface EnsembleErrorResponse {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details: {
      providerStatuses: { [key: string]: 'success' | 'failed' | 'timeout' };
      partialResults?: Partial<EnsembleResponse>;
      degradedMode: boolean;
    };
    timestamp: string;
  };
}
```

### Performance Requirements
[Source: epic-2-multi-model-llm-ensemble.md]
Ensemble orchestration must meet performance targets:
- Total response time: <15 seconds for complete ensemble analysis
- Provider timeout: <10 seconds per provider to allow for retries
- Parallel efficiency: >80% time utilization (minimize sequential processing)
- Degraded mode: Continue operation with minimum 1 provider available
- Cost efficiency: <$0.50 total per ensemble query across all providers

### Configuration Schema
Expected configuration structure for ensemble orchestration:
```typescript
interface EnsembleConfig {
  providers: {
    enabled: string[];
    priority: { [key: string]: number };
    weights: { [key: string]: number };
  };
  performance: {
    maxTotalTimeout: number;
    maxProviderTimeout: number;
    minProvidersRequired: number;
    enableLoadBalancing: boolean;
  };
  aggregation: {
    consensusThreshold: number;
    confidenceWeighting: {
      agreement: number;
      completeness: number;
      consistency: number;
    };
    componentClusteringThreshold: number;
  };
  monitoring: {
    enablePerformanceTracking: boolean;
    enableHealthChecks: boolean;
    healthCheckInterval: number;
  };
}
```

### Testing

- **Unit Tests**: Jest with 90%+ code coverage requirement for orchestration logic
