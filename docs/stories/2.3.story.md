  - Connect with component database for highlighting
  - Create comprehensive test suite for viewer functionality
  - Performance testing with real electrical drawings

## Technical Guidance

### PDF Rendering Technology
- **PDF.js Integration:** Use Mozilla PDF.js for reliable cross-browser PDF rendering
- **Canvas Optimization:** Implement high-DPI canvas rendering for crisp display
- **Viewport Management:** Efficient viewport calculations for smooth scrolling
- **Memory Management:** Smart caching and cleanup for large documents

### Component Detection
- **SVG Overlay System:** Use SVG layers for interactive elements over PDF content
- **Hit Testing:** Implement precise click detection on irregular component shapes
- **Selection Visual Feedback:** Customizable highlighting with multiple selection states
- **Component Metadata:** Integration with component database for specifications

### Annotation Framework
- **Vector Graphics:** SVG-based annotation system for scalability
- **Collaboration Features:** Real-time annotation sharing and conflict resolution
- **Export Formats:** Support for PDF, SVG, and image export with annotations
- **Undo/Redo System:** Complete action history for annotation editing

### Multi-Drawing Features
- **Synchronized Views:** Coordinated zoom, pan, and navigation across drawings
- **Difference Engine:** Pixel-based and vector-based comparison algorithms
- **Overlay Blending:** Customizable opacity and blending modes
- **Layout Management:** Flexible arrangement of multiple drawing views

### Performance Considerations
- **Progressive Rendering:** Load and render pages on-demand
- **Worker Threads:** Off-main-thread processing for heavy operations
- **Caching Strategy:** Multi-level caching (memory, localStorage, IndexedDB)
- **Lazy Loading:** Defer loading of non-visible drawing elements
