# Epic 4: Component Identification & Description

## Overview

The Component Identification & Description system automatically detects, identifies, and describes electrical symbols and components within uploaded drawings, providing detailed technical information and cross-references.

## User Story

**As an** electrical professional  
**I want** automatic identification of electrical components in drawings  
**So that** I can quickly understand what components are present and their specifications without manual symbol lookup  

## Functional Requirements

- Automatic detection of electrical symbols and components
- Detailed descriptions including function and specifications
- Cross-referencing between related components
- Symbol library matching with industry standards

## Technical Requirements

- Computer vision processing for symbol detection
- Electrical component database integration
- Symbol-to-description mapping system
- Confidence scoring for identifications

## Output Requirements

- Component list with locations and descriptions
- Visual overlay highlighting identified components
- Detailed specifications where available
- Links to related components in the drawing

## Story Breakdown Guide

### Planned Stories: 5 stories total
1. **Story 4.1**: Symbol Detection Engine - Computer vision for electrical symbol recognition - 8 points (3-4 days)
2. **Story 4.2**: Component Database Integration - Symbol-to-specification mapping system - 5 points (2-3 days)
3. **Story 4.3**: Visual Overlay System - Highlighting and labeling identified components - 5 points (2-3 days)
4. **Story 4.4**: Cross-Reference Engine - Component relationship mapping across pages - 5 points (2-3 days)
5. **Story 4.5**: Component Export & Reporting - Generate component lists and specifications - 3 points (1-2 days)

### Story Dependencies
- Story 4.1 → Story 4.2 (Database integration needs detection results)
- Story 4.1 → Story 4.3 (Visual overlay needs detected component locations)
- Stories 4.2, 4.3 → Story 4.4 (Cross-referencing needs component data and visuals)
- Story 4.4 → Story 4.5 (Export needs complete component analysis)

### Epic Completion Criteria
Epic is complete when:
- [ ] All 5 stories are Done (QA approved)
- [ ] 90% accuracy on standard electrical symbols achieved
- [ ] Visual highlighting works for all identified components
- [ ] Cross-references function across multi-page drawings
- [ ] Component export generates useful reports

### Epic Dependencies
- **Requires**: Epic 2 (Multi-model ensemble for accurate identification)
- **Requires**: Epic 1 (PDF processing for image analysis)
- **Enhances**: Epic 3 (Q&A system benefits from component knowledge)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Identifies 90% of standard electrical symbols correctly
- [ ] Provides meaningful descriptions for identified components
- [ ] Cross-references work correctly between drawing pages
- [ ] Users can easily locate components in drawings

## Dependencies

- Multi-Model LLM Ensemble (Epic 2)
- PDF processing and image analysis
- Electrical component knowledge base
- Visual highlighting system

## Technical Architecture

### Detection Engine
- Symbol recognition algorithms
- Pattern matching with component library
- Machine learning-based classification
- Confidence scoring system

### Component Database
- Standard electrical symbol library
- Component specifications database
- Cross-reference mapping system
- Industry standard compliance checking

### Visualization System
- Visual overlay rendering
- Component highlighting interface
- Interactive component selection
- Location mapping and coordination

## Success Metrics

- Symbol identification accuracy: >90%
- User satisfaction with identifications: >4.0/5.0
- Coverage of standard electrical symbols: >95%
- False positive rate: <5%

## Implementation Priority

**Priority:** High (Core Analysis Feature)  
**Sprint:** Phase 2 (Weeks 4-7)  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 sprints

## Risk Considerations

- Accuracy challenges with hand-drawn or non-standard symbols
- Performance impact of complex visual processing
- Maintaining up-to-date component databases
- Handling variations in drawing styles and standards
- False positive identification affecting user trust
