# Epic 5: Simple Schematic Recreation

## Overview

The Simple Schematic Recreation system generates simplified, interactive schematic representations of key electrical circuits from the uploaded drawings, providing visual validation of AI understanding and circuit comprehension.

## User Story

**As an** electrical professional  
**I want** to see simplified schematics of the main circuits  
**So that** I can validate the AI's understanding and get a clear overview of circuit relationships  

## Functional Requirements

- Generate simplified schematic representations of key circuits
- Visual validation of AI understanding
- Interactive schematic with component labels
- Export capability for validation purposes

## Technical Requirements

- SVG-based schematic generation
- Component positioning algorithms
- Connection tracing between elements
- Schematic layout optimization

## Limitations

- Focus on main circuits only (not detailed sub-circuits)
- Simplified representation (not CAD-quality)
- Manual verification required for critical applications
- Export limited to static images

## Story Breakdown Guide

### Planned Stories: 4 stories total
1. **Story 5.1**: Circuit Analysis Engine - Detect main circuits and trace connections - 8 points (3-4 days)
2. **Story 5.2**: SVG Schematic Renderer - Generate clean schematic representations - 8 points (3-4 days)
3. **Story 5.3**: Interactive Schematic UI - User interaction and component labeling - 5 points (2-3 days)
4. **Story 5.4**: Export & Validation System - Export schematics and validation tools - 3 points (1-2 days)

### Story Dependencies
- Story 5.1 → Story 5.2 (SVG rendering needs circuit analysis results)
- Story 5.2 → Story 5.3 (Interactive UI needs rendered schematics)
- Story 5.3 → Story 5.4 (Export needs interactive schematic system)

### Epic Completion Criteria
