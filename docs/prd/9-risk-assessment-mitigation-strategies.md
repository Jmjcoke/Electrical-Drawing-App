- **Fallback:** Focus on educational and training use cases initially
- **Prevention:** Engage with industry associations and thought leaders

**Engagement Plan:**
- Weekly user interviews and feedback sessions
- Industry conference participation and demonstration
- Partnership with electrical trade organizations

**Risk: Insufficient Market Demand**
- **Probability:** Low (15%)
- **Impact:** High
- **Description:** Actual demand for AI-powered electrical drawing analysis may be lower than anticipated.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Immediate:** Validate demand through user interviews and surveys
- **Ongoing:** Monitor usage patterns and user engagement metrics
- **Fallback:** Pivot to adjacent markets (HVAC, mechanical drawings)
- **Prevention:** Continuous market research and user feedback

**Validation Plan:**
- Monthly market demand surveys
- Competitive analysis and positioning research
- Customer discovery interviews

### 9.2.2 Medium-Priority Market Risks

**Risk: Competitive Response**
- **Probability:** Medium (25%)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Description:** Established CAD software providers or new entrants may quickly develop competing solutions.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Immediate:** Establish intellectual property and technical differentiation
- **Ongoing:** Build strong user relationships and network effects
- **Fallback:** Focus on superior accuracy and user experience
- **Prevention:** Rapid feature development and market penetration

**Risk: Regulatory or Industry Standard Changes**
- **Probability:** Low (10%)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Description:** Changes in electrical codes or drawing standards may affect system accuracy or compliance.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Immediate:** Monitor industry standard organizations and regulatory bodies
- **Ongoing:** Design flexible system that can adapt to standard changes
- **Fallback:** Focus on analysis rather than compliance validation
- **Prevention:** Industry expert advisory board participation

## 9.3 Business and Resource Risks

### 9.3.1 High-Priority Business Risks

**Risk: Development Timeline Delays**
- **Probability:** Medium (30%)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Description:** Technical complexity or unforeseen challenges may delay MVP delivery beyond 3-month target.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Immediate:** Build timeline buffers and prioritize ruthlessly
- **Ongoing:** Weekly progress reviews and scope adjustment
- **Fallback:** Reduce MVP scope to core features only
- **Prevention:** Conservative estimation and parallel development streams

**Risk: Cost Escalation**
- **Probability:** Low (15%)
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Description:** LLM API costs or infrastructure expenses may exceed budget projections.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Immediate:** Implement cost monitoring and budget alerts
- **Ongoing:** Optimize API usage and implement caching strategies
- **Fallback:** Implement usage limits and premium tiers
- **Prevention:** Conservative cost modeling and provider negotiation

### 9.3.2 Medium-Priority Business Risks
