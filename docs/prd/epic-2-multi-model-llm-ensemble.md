# Epic 2: Multi-Model LLM Ensemble

## Overview

The Multi-Model LLM Ensemble orchestrates simultaneous analysis from multiple vision-language models (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Pro) to provide superior accuracy and reliability through consensus-based responses.

## User Story

**As an** electrical professional  
**I want** AI analysis that combines insights from multiple models  
**So that** I can trust the accuracy and reliability of the electrical drawing interpretation  

## Functional Requirements

- Simultaneous processing through GPT-4V, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini Pro
- Confidence scoring based on model agreement
- Fallback handling for API failures or rate limits
- Response aggregation and consensus building

## Technical Requirements

- Async API calls to all three providers
- Standardized prompt templates for consistent results
- Response parsing and normalization across different API formats
- Rate limiting and cost optimization

## Performance Requirements

- Total response time under 15 seconds for standard queries
- 99% uptime during business hours
- Graceful degradation with single model failure
- Cost per query under $0.50

## Story Breakdown Guide

### Planned Stories: 5 stories total
1. **Story 2.1**: Provider Integration Framework - Abstract provider interface and multi-provider support - 8 points (3-4 days)
2. **Story 2.2**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet Integration - Add Anthropic Claude provider to ensemble - 5 points (2-3 days)
3. **Story 2.3**: Gemini Pro Integration - Add Google Gemini provider to ensemble - 5 points (2-3 days)
4. **Story 2.4**: Ensemble Orchestration Engine - Parallel processing and response aggregation - 8 points (3-4 days)
5. **Story 2.5**: Consensus & Confidence Scoring - Agreement analysis and confidence indicators - 5 points (2-3 days)

### Story Dependencies
- Story 2.1 → Story 2.2 (Claude integration needs provider framework)
- Story 2.1 → Story 2.3 (Gemini integration needs provider framework)
- Stories 2.2, 2.3 → Story 2.4 (Orchestration needs all providers available)
- Story 2.4 → Story 2.5 (Consensus requires aggregated responses)

### Epic Completion Criteria
Epic is complete when:
- [ ] All 5 stories are Done (QA approved)
- [ ] All three providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) integrated successfully
- [ ] Ensemble shows >15% accuracy improvement over single models
- [ ] System handles single-provider failures gracefully
- [ ] Response times consistently under 15 seconds

### Epic Dependencies
- **Requires**: Epic 1 (PDF processing and LLM foundation)
- **Enables**: Epic 3 (Interactive Q&A needs ensemble responses)
- **Enables**: Epic 4 (Component identification uses ensemble analysis)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All three models process queries successfully 95% of the time
- [ ] Ensemble responses show measurably higher accuracy than single models
- [ ] System continues functioning with any single model unavailable
- [ ] Response times meet performance targets

## Dependencies

- API access to all three LLM providers
- PDF processing system (Epic 1)
- Prompt engineering templates
- Response aggregation algorithms

## Technical Architecture

### API Integration Layer
- OpenAI GPT-4V integration
- Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet integration
- Google Gemini Pro integration
