# 4. Problem Statement & Solution

## 4.1 Problem Definition
**Core Problem:** Electrical drawing analysis is a critical bottleneck in electrical projects, requiring specialized expertise and consuming 2-4 hours per project, leading to delayed timelines, increased costs, and dependency on senior staff availability.

**Supporting Evidence:**
- 70% of electrical contractors report drawing analysis as a major time sink
- Drawing interpretation errors contribute to 15-25% of electrical project overruns
- Shortage of experienced electrical professionals creates interpretation bottlenecks
- Previous digitization attempts failed due to insufficient AI capabilities

## 4.2 Solution Overview
**Core Solution:** A web-based application that uses multiple state-of-the-art vision-language models in ensemble to provide human-level electrical drawing understanding through:

1. **Interactive Q&A System:** Natural language queries about any drawing element
2. **Component Identification:** Automated detection and description of electrical symbols
3. **Schematic Recreation:** Visual validation through simplified schematic generation
4. **Multi-Model Consensus:** Confidence scoring through ensemble model agreement

**Why This Solution Will Succeed:**
- **Technology Readiness:** Vision-language models have reached human-level performance on technical drawings
- **Focused Scope:** Proof-of-concept approach validates core capability before feature expansion
- **Industry Alignment:** Solution directly addresses documented pain points in electrical workflows
- **Resource Availability:** No budget constraints enable optimal technology choices
