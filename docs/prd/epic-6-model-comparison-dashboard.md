# Epic 6: Model Comparison Dashboard

## Overview

The Model Comparison Dashboard provides transparency into the AI decision-making process by showing side-by-side comparisons of responses from different models, confidence indicators, and agreement/disagreement analysis.

## User Story

**As an** electrical professional  
**I want to** see how different AI models interpret the same drawing  
**So that** I can understand the confidence level and make informed decisions about trusting the analysis  

## Functional Requirements

- Side-by-side comparison of responses from different models
- Confidence indicators based on model agreement
- Ability to select preferred model responses
- Transparency in AI decision-making

## User Interface Requirements

- Clear visual separation of model responses
- Agreement/disagreement highlighting
- Model performance indicators
- User feedback collection on response quality

## Technical Requirements

- Response storage and comparison algorithms
- Agreement scoring methodology
- User preference tracking
- Performance analytics collection

## Story Breakdown Guide

### Planned Stories: 3 stories total
1. **Story 6.1**: Comparison Dashboard UI - Side-by-side model response interface - 8 points (3-4 days)
2. **Story 6.2**: Agreement Analysis Engine - Calculate confidence and consensus metrics - 5 points (2-3 days)
3. **Story 6.3**: User Feedback & Learning System - Collect preferences and improve ensemble - 5 points (2-3 days)

### Story Dependencies
- Story 6.1 → Story 6.2 (Agreement analysis needs dashboard for display)
- Story 6.2 → Story 6.3 (Learning system needs agreement metrics)

### Epic Completion Criteria
Epic is complete when:
- [ ] All 3 stories are Done (QA approved)
- [ ] Dashboard clearly shows side-by-side model comparisons
- [ ] Agreement/disagreement indicators are visually intuitive
- [ ] 90% of users understand confidence indicators
- [ ] System successfully learns from user feedback

### Epic Dependencies
- **Requires**: Epic 2 (Multi-model ensemble generates comparable responses)
- **Enhances**: Epic 3 (Q&A system benefits from transparency features)
- **Enhances**: Epic 4 (Component identification transparency)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can easily compare model responses
- [ ] Agreement/disagreement is visually clear
- [ ] Users understand confidence indicators
- [ ] System learns from user preferences

## Dependencies

- Multi-Model LLM Ensemble (Epic 2)
- Response storage system
- User interface framework
- Analytics collection system

## Technical Architecture

### Comparison Engine
- Response analysis algorithms
- Agreement detection logic
- Confidence scoring calculation
- Quality assessment metrics

### Dashboard Interface
- Multi-panel response display
- Visual agreement indicators
- Interactive model selection
- Performance visualization

### Learning System
- User preference tracking
- Response quality feedback
- Model performance analytics
- Continuous improvement metrics

## Success Metrics

- User understanding of confidence indicators: >90%
- Dashboard usage rate: >70% of sessions
- User trust in ensemble vs. single model: +20%
- Quality of user feedback: >4.0/5.0

## Implementation Priority

**Priority:** Medium (Transparency Feature)  
**Sprint:** Phase 3 (Weeks 8-10)  
**Estimated Effort:** 2 sprints

## Risk Considerations

- Information overload from too much model comparison detail
- User confusion about which response to trust
- Performance impact of storing and comparing multiple responses
- Complexity of explaining AI confidence to non-technical users
- Risk of users becoming overly focused on model disagreements
