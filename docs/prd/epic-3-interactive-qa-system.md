# Epic 3: Interactive Q&A System

## Overview

The Interactive Q&A System provides a natural language interface for users to ask questions about electrical drawings and receive contextual, intelligent responses from the AI ensemble. This epic delivers the primary user interaction capability.

## User Story

**As an** electrical professional  
**I want to** ask natural language questions about electrical drawings  
**So that** I can quickly understand complex circuits and components without manual analysis  

## Functional Requirements

- Natural language query input with autocomplete suggestions
- Context-aware responses referencing specific drawing elements
- Follow-up question capability building on previous queries
- Query history within session

## User Interface Requirements

- Chat-like interface with clear question/answer separation
- Visual highlighting of referenced drawing elements
- Suggested questions based on drawing content
- Easy copy/paste of responses

## Performance Requirements

- Query response time under 15 seconds
- Support for 50+ queries per session
- Accurate context retention across conversation
- Clear indication of AI vs. definitive answers

## Story Breakdown Guide

### Planned Stories: 4 stories total
1. **Story 3.1**: Chat Interface Foundation - Basic Q&A interface with message history - 8 points (3-4 days)
2. **Story 3.2**: Natural Language Processing - Query intent recognition and processing - 5 points (2-3 days)
3. **Story 3.3**: Context Management System - Conversation context and follow-up capability - 5 points (2-3 days)
4. **Story 3.4**: Visual Element Highlighting - Link responses to drawing locations - 8 points (3-4 days)

### Story Dependencies
- Story 3.1 → Story 3.2 (NLP needs chat interface foundation)
- Story 3.2 → Story 3.3 (Context management builds on query processing)
- Story 3.3 → Story 3.4 (Visual highlighting requires context awareness)

### Epic Completion Criteria
Epic is complete when:
- [ ] All 4 stories are Done (QA approved)
- [ ] Users can ask natural language questions about drawings
- [ ] System maintains context across conversation turns
- [ ] Visual highlighting works for referenced elements
- [ ] 90% user satisfaction with responses achieved

### Epic Dependencies
- **Requires**: Epic 2 (Multi-model ensemble for intelligent responses)
- **Requires**: Epic 1 (PDF processing for drawing display)
- **Enables**: Epic 4 (Component identification enhances Q&A responses)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can ask about any visible drawing element
- [ ] Responses include specific location references
- [ ] 90% of responses are rated as helpful by users
- [ ] System maintains context across related queries

## Dependencies

- Multi-Model LLM Ensemble (Epic 2)
- PDF processing and display system
- Context management system
- User interface framework

## Technical Architecture

### Query Processing
- Natural language processing pipeline
- Intent recognition and categorization
- Context extraction from conversation history
- Query optimization for LLM providers

### Response Management
- Response aggregation from ensemble
- Context-aware answer generation
- Reference linking to drawing elements
- Quality scoring and validation

### User Interface Components
- Chat interface with message history
- Query input with autocomplete
- Response display with formatting
- Visual element highlighting system

## Success Metrics

- User satisfaction with responses: >4.0/5.0
- Response accuracy rating: >90%
- Average queries per session: >8
- Query response time: <15 seconds

## Implementation Priority

**Priority:** High (Core User Experience)  
**Sprint:** Phase 2 (Weeks 4-7)  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 sprints

## Risk Considerations

- Context management complexity across long conversations
- Response quality consistency across different query types
- Performance optimization for real-time interaction
- User experience design for technical vs. non-technical users
- Handling ambiguous or unclear user queries
