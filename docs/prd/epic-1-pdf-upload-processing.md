## Story Breakdown Guide

### Planned Stories: 4 stories total
1. **Story 1.1**: Basic PDF Upload Interface - Single file upload with validation - 8 points (3-5 days)
2. **Story 1.2**: Multi-File Upload Support - Upload up to 3 PDFs simultaneously - 5 points (2-3 days)  
3. **Story 1.3**: PDF to Image Conversion - Convert uploaded PDFs to high-resolution images - 5 points (2-3 days)
4. **Story 1.4**: LLM Integration Foundation - Basic LLM infrastructure for image analysis - 8 points (3-4 days)

### Story Dependencies
