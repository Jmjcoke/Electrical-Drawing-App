# Requirements Overview

## Core Problem Statement

Electrical drawing analysis is a critical bottleneck in electrical projects, requiring specialized expertise and consuming 2-4 hours per project, leading to delayed timelines, increased costs, and dependency on senior staff availability.

## Solution Approach

A web-based application that uses multiple state-of-the-art vision-language models in ensemble to provide human-level electrical drawing understanding through:

1. **Interactive Q&A System:** Natural language queries about any drawing element
2. **Component Identification:** Automated detection and description of electrical symbols  
3. **Schematic Recreation:** Visual validation through simplified schematic generation
4. **Multi-Model Consensus:** Confidence scoring through ensemble model agreement

## Target Users
