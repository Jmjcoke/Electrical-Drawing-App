# ELECTRICAL ORCHESTRATOR - Project Memory

## Project Overview

**Primary Objective**: Transform brownfield electrical project estimation from manual guesswork into AI-powered precision by creating an interactive platform that combines PDF drawing analysis, circuit tracing, and historical project data to deliver accurate man-hour estimates for oil & gas electrical work.

**Core Problem**: Current brownfield electrical estimation methods consistently fail, leading to cost overruns and project delays. Engineers waste hours manually analyzing PDF drawings to trace circuits, while project managers rely on inaccurate estimates that don't account for brownfield integration complexity.

**MVP Success Definition**: Achieve 80%+ improvement in estimation accuracy and reduce circuit analysis time from hours to minutes through automated cloud detection, interactive circuit tracing, and AI-powered man-hour estimation based on 5+ years of real completion data.

## BMAD Method Integration

This project follows the **BMAD Method V3 "Agent Preview"** for AI-driven development:

### Core BMAD Principles
- **Vibe CEO'ing**: Think like a CEO with unlimited resources and singular vision
- **AI as High-Powered Team**: Leverage specialized AI agents for different project phases  
- **Iterative Refinement**: Embrace non-linear development with continuous improvement
- **Quality Control**: Human oversight as ultimate arbiter of quality
- **Strategic Oversight**: Maintain high-level vision while agents handle execution

### BMAD Agent Orchestrator
