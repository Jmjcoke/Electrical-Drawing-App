## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic MVP Usage
```python
from specification_intelligence_mvp import MVPSpecificationAPI

# Initialize MVP service
api = MVPSpecificationAPI()

# Get component specification
request = {
    "manufacturer": "Rosemount",
    "model_number": "3051S", 
    "component_id": "PT-001",
    "category": "pressure_transmitter"
}

result = await api.get_component_specs(request)
print(f"Specification: {result['specification']}")
```

### Easy Tier Upgrades
```python
from feature_manager import enable_professional_features, enable_enterprise_features

# Upgrade to Professional tier
enable_professional_features()

# Now access advanced features
from feature_manager import get_advanced_feature

ml_engine = get_advanced_feature("advanced_ml")
process_validator = get_advanced_feature("process_control")

# Upgrade to Enterprise tier for full capabilities
enable_enterprise_features()

simulation_engine = get_advanced_feature("simulation")
predictive_maintenance = get_advanced_feature("predictive_maintenance")
```

2. Full enterprise capabilities enabled
3. Existing professional features continue working
4. Access to simulation, optimization, and predictive maintenance

### Feature Detection
```python
from feature_manager import is_feature_enabled

if is_feature_enabled("predictive_maintenance"):
    # Show predictive maintenance UI
    pm_data = service.get_predictive_maintenance(component_id, sensor_data)
else:
    # Show basic health status
    health_status = "Basic monitoring active"
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run MVP Tests
```bash
cd src/backend/services/component-intelligence
python specification_intelligence_mvp.py
```

### Test Professional Features
```python
from feature_manager import enable_professional_features
enable_professional_features()

# Test advanced features
ml_engine = get_advanced_feature("advanced_ml")
# ... test ML functionality
