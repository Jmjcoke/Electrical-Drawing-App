# Project Brief: Computer Vision Implementation for Story 4.1 - Symbol Detection Engine

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on replacing the current mock computer vision algorithms in the Symbol Detection Engine with production-ready implementations capable of accurately detecting electrical symbols in PDF engineering drawings. The existing system provides solid API infrastructure, testing frameworks, and queue management, but requires real OpenCV/ML integration to meet the 30-second processing requirement and achieve production-level accuracy.

## Problem Statement

**Current State:**
- Symbol Detection Engine has comprehensive API structure with `SymbolDetectionService`, `MLClassifier`, and `PatternMatcher` classes
- All computer vision algorithms are currently mocked implementations returning simulated results
- Pattern matching uses placeholder contour detection and template matching
- ML classification generates synthetic probabilities rather than running actual inference
- Image processing capabilities are limited to basic preprocessing mock functions

**Technical Gaps:**
- No actual OpenCV integration for image preprocessing, edge detection, or contour analysis
- Missing real ML model implementation for electrical symbol classification
- Template matching system lacks actual template library and matching algorithms
- Feature extraction generates mock data instead of computing real image features
- No integration with actual computer vision libraries or pre-trained models

**Impact on System:**
- Cannot process real PDF drawings with meaningful results
- Performance characteristics unknown for actual computer vision workloads
- Accuracy metrics are not representative of production capabilities
- Integration testing limited due to mock implementations
